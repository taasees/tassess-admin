/**
 * Writes objects from `options.data` into files. Every object in `options.data`
 * must have a `__metadata` object with `srcObjectId` property. The `srcObjectId`
 * is a file path relative to `options.dirPath` specifying where that object
 * should be saved. The `__metadata` object is omitted before object is written.
 *
 * If `srcObjectId` ends with `.md` extension, all object's properties except the
 * `markdown_content` will be saved as frontmatter, while the `markdown_content`
 * property will be  saved as markdown content below the frontmatter.
 *
 * If file to be written already exists and has the exactly same content, the
 * write action will not be performed. This would prevent potential file-watchers
 * from recognizing a change in file where no actual content change occurs. If
 * none of the objects were written, this method returns `false`.
 *
 * @param {Object} options The options object
 * @param {string} dirPath The directory where items will be stored.
 * @param {Array} options.data Array of items, where every item will be written as a separate file to disk.
 * @return {Promise<boolean>} Returns `true` if at least one file was written to disk.
